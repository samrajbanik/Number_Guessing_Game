# Number_Guessing_Game
Here's a breakdown of its functionality:
|| Includes necessary headers: Imports the iostream, cstdlib, and ctime libraries for input/output, random number generation, and time functions, respectively.
|| Generates a random number: Creates a random number between 1 and 100 using the rand() function and stores it in secretNumber.
|| Prompts user input: Asks the user to enter a guess.
|| Compares guess with secret number: Checks if the user's guess matches the secret number.
|| Provides feedback: If the guess is incorrect, it provides hints indicating whether the guess is too high or too low.
|| Repeats until correct: The game continues in a loop until the user guesses the correct number.
